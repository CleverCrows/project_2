Credits to 'soumibardhan10' on geeksforgeeks who's guide formed the basis for the multi-page format for tkinter.
Some documentation and naming left over from their code due to their better knowledge of its workings. Everything else
has been written by hand other than the functionality for multiple pages and page switching.
